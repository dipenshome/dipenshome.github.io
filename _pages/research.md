    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 14px;">Nuclear Power is the cleanliest of all other power sources available with comparatively low fuel cost and zero Carbon-di-Oxide (CO2) and other Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) utilizes the heat generated from nuclear fission reaction of Uranium-235 to produce steam which then rotates “Turbine” and generates electricity. These NPPs are equipped with “state-of-the-art” safety equipment and protection systems to check any kind of harmful radiation to the outside environment. Despite these safety systems, an accident can happen in a NPP due to various reasons i.e. human error, equipment failure, natural disaster etc. So, to assess the integrity of different components of NPP in the event of Nuclear Accident, it is a good practice to study those transients before putting a NPP in operation. With the advancement of computing power and resources, it becomes both economical and feasible to study these transients in a more efficient way providing a good insight of what actually is happening inside the reactor during accidents. In this work, Personal Computer Transient Analyzer, abbreviated as PCTRAN, is used to simulate 4 different Design Basis Accidents (DBA) named Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR), Main Steam Line Break (MSLB), Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) and Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). A plant specific PCTRAN model for VVER-1000 Pressurized Water Reactor has been used. The results obtained from the simulation show that, VVER-1000 active and passive safety systems is capable to mitigate the consequences of these accidents hence reducing the possibility of radioactivity release into the atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 14px;">The objective of this paper is to present and analyze the results of simulated tube rupture accident in VVER-1000 Nuclear Reactor in PCTRAN. In simulating the accident, 100% of one full tube rupture has been considered. The simulation result shows that the core pressure experience a rapid decrease from initial value of 155 bar (15.5 MPa) and stabilize around 80 bar (8 MPa) after the accident. This leads to stopping coolant leakage from primary circuit to secondary circuit due to absence of pressure differential between primary and secondary loop. After the initiation of tube rupture, the leak from affected Steam Generator ‘A’ is about 3000 t/h (833.33 kg/s) which is reduced to approximately 500 t/h(138.89kg/s) within 200s of the accident. The result also shows that the reactor power (both ‘Thermal’ and ‘Nuclear Flux’) collapses drastically following reactor trip. Both High Pressure Injection (HPI) pump is activated following “Reactor Scram” to prevent core damage. The average temperature of coolant at the reactor inlet decreases from 580K to 560K to facilitate cooling down of the primary coolant. The data obtained from the simulation are satisfactorily consistent with PSAR (Preliminary Safety Assessment Report) data regarding SGTR accident. These findings are expected to provide useful information in understanding and evaluating plants capability to mitigate the consequence of SGTR accident.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 14px;">This study analyzes the declining cost trends of solar photovoltaic (PV) installation and its impact on electricity generation affordability worldwide. Secondary data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), specifically from the Renewable Capacity Statistics 2024 report, is utilized to examine global trends in solar PV deployment, cost reductions, and market expansion. A descriptive statistical approach is employed to assess historical and recent data, identifying key patterns and investment trajectories influencing solar energy growth. The findings reveal that from 2010 to 2022,the capital expenditure (CAPEX) for solar PV installation dropped from 5,124 per kW to 876 per kW, marking an 83% cost reduction. Over the same period, the capacity factor increased from 14% to 17%, and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) decreased from 0.445 per kWh to 0.049 per kWh, an 89% decline. The study highlights that 81% of global solar PV capacity is concentrated in just 10 countries, with China leading (43.16%), followed by the United States (9.75%), Japan (6.17%), Germany (5.79%), and India (5.15%). Additionally, the LCOE of solar PV became less than half the cost of fossil fuel-based power generation by 2022, where fossil fuel LCOE ranged between 0.15 to 0.16 per kWh. The total installed solar PV capacity grew from 40,277 MW in 2010 to 1,046,614 MW in 2022, demonstrating exponential growth. Moreover, over the last 22 years, solar PV contributed to fuel cost savings of $27.16 billion, accounting for 16% of total savings from all renewable sources. These results underscore the increasing economic viability of solar PV and its crucial role in global energy transitions. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and energy planners, supporting data-driven decision-making for expanding solar energy infrastructure and achieving sustainable energy goals.</p>
