        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Abstract</strong>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;text-align: justify; font-size: 14px;">Nuclear Power is the cleanliest of all other power sources available with comparatively lowfuel cost and zero Carbon-di-Oxide (CO2) and other Green House Gas (GHG) emissions.
        Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) utilizes the heat generated from nuclear fission reaction of Uranium-235 to produce steam which then rotates “Turbine” and generates electricity. These
        NPPs are equipped with “state-of-the-art” safety equipment and protection systems to check
        any kind of harmful radiation to the outside environment. Despite these safety systems, an
        accident can happen in a NPP due to various reasons i.e. human error, equipment failure,
        natural disaster etc. So, to assess the integrity of different components of NPP in the event of
        Nuclear Accident, it is a good practice to study those transients before putting a NPP in
        operation. With the advancement of computing power and resources, it becomes both
        economical and feasible to study these transients in a more efficient way providing a good
        insight of what actually is happening inside the reactor during accidents. In this work, Personal
        Computer Transient Analyzer, abbreviated as PCTRAN, is used to simulate 4 different Design
        Basis Accidents (DBA) named Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR), Main Steam Line
        Break (MSLB), Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) and Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). A plant
        specific PCTRAN model for VVER-1000 Pressurized Water Reactor has been used. The
        results obtained from the simulation show that, VVER-1000 active and passive safety systems
        is capable to mitigate the consequences of these accidents hence reducing the possibility of
        radioactivity release into the atmosphere.
