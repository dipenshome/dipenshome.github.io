        <blockquote style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left;">Abstract</blockquote>
        <p style="text-indent: 16px; text-align: justify;"><em>Nuclear Power is the cleanliest of all other power sources available with comparatively low
            fuel cost and zero Carbon-di-Oxide (CO2) and other Green House Gas (GHG) emissions.
            Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) utilizes the heat generated from nuclear fission reaction of
            Uranium-235 to produce steam which then rotates “Turbine” and generates electricity. These
            NPPs are equipped with “state-of-the-art” safety equipment and protection systems to check
            any kind of harmful radiation to the outside environment. Despite these safety systems, an
            accident can happen in a NPP due to various reasons i.e. human error, equipment failure,
            natural disaster etc. So, to assess the integrity of different components of NPP in the event of
            Nuclear Accident, it is a good practice to study those transients before putting a NPP in
            operation. With the advancement of computing power and resources, it becomes both
            economical and feasible to study these transients in a more efficient way providing a good
            insight of what actually is happening inside the reactor during accidents. In this work, Personal
            Computer Transient Analyzer, abbreviated as PCTRAN, is used to simulate 4 different Design
            Basis Accidents (DBA) named Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR), Main Steam Line
            Break (MSLB), Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) and Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). A plant
            specific PCTRAN model for VVER-1000 Pressurized Water Reactor has been used. The
            results obtained from the simulation show that, VVER-1000 active and passive safety systems
            is capable to mitigate the consequences of these accidents hence reducing the possibility of
            radioactivity release into the atmosphere.</em></p>
