  <p style="text-indent:20px; font-size:16px;">
  <b style="font-size:30px;color:#BB2649;">Hello,</b> 
I am <strong style="font-size:20px;color: #191970;">Dipen Shome (Shourav)</strong>, from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology, the country's top and highly competitive engineering university, with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:20px; font-size:16px;">Professionally, I have been in the industry for more than eight years. I started my career as a <strong style="color: #191970;">Design Engineer </strong>in the Research & Development (R&D) Team of a renowned Power System Equipment Manufacturing Company in my country. In this role, I developed my skills in the design of mechanical components, specializing in the utilization of cutting-edge 3D mechanical design and engineering simulation software such as <strong>SolidWorks, Ansys Workbench, and PTC Creo.</strong></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:20px; font-size:16px;">Currently, I am working as <strong style="color:#191970;">Lead Operations Engineer (Turbine)</strong> (more than 6 years)  in my country's first <strong style="color:#BB2649;">Nuclear Power Station</strong>. In this role, I have worked extensively in <strong style="color: #191970;">Operation and Maintenance (O&M)</strong> of large-scale rotating machinery (i.e. <em>Steam Turbine, Generator, Pumps</em>) as well as thermal equipment (i.e. <em>Condenser, Heat Exchanger</em>) and plant reliability operations, gaining substantial hands-on experience into equipment behavior, failure mechanisms, and operational diagnostics. Working in a Nuclear Power Station is a challenging but incredibly rewarding role as well. Every day, I am involved in ensuring safe and effiecient operaion of the plant's process system equipment crucial for power generation. It requires a blend of technical knowledge, analytical thinking and attention to detail - something that I found both stimulating and deeply satisfying.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:20px; font-size:16px;">Over the past several years, I have developed a burgeoning interest in the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to solve mechanical engineering challenges as there has been observed a paradigm shift to <strong style="color:#BB2649;">Industry 4.0</strong>. My current research focus include the application of AI for <strong style="color:#191970;"><em>Predictive Maintenance</em>, <em>Industrial Inspection</em>, <em>Additive Manufacturing</em></strong>. I look forward to opportunities to pursue a <strong style="color:#BB2649;">Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering </strong>, with the objective of conducting impactful research and meaningful innovation.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:20px; font-size:16px;"> Finally, as I continue to navigate the challenges of ever-evolving engineering landscape, my commitment remains unwavering - <strong style="color: #0072B5;">to drive progress, inspire innovation, and contribute meaningfully to the intersection of science and creativity.</strong>
