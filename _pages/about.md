Hello, I am Dipen from Dhaka, Bangladesh, currently working as a Mechanical Engineer in my country's first Nuclear Power Station. Being a graduate of Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology with a Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering, my professional journey has been marked by a passion for innovation and problem-solving. Working in a Nuclear Power Station is a chalenging but incredibly rewarding role as well. Every day, I am involved in ensuring safe and effiecient operaion of plant's process system equipment crucial for power generation. It requires a blend of technical knowledge, analytical thinking and attention to detail - something that I found both stimulating and deeply satisfying.

I started my career as a Design Engineer in the Research & Development (R&D) Team of a renowned Power System Equipment Manufacturing Company in my country. In this role, I developed my skills in Design of Mechanical Components, specializing in the utilization of cutting-edge 3D Mechanical Design and Engineering Simulation Software such as SolidWorks, Ansys Workbench and PTC Creo.

As I continue to navigate the challeges of ever-evolving engineering landscape, my commitment remains unwavering - to drive progress, inspire innovation, and contribute meaningfully to the intersection of scrience and creativity.
